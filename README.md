## Description
This is the backend for my clone of https://stayhard.se which I created for a school project.

The project is running [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) which is a framework for building Node.js applications.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```
You will need to create a .env file and provide appropriate values for each key. There is a .env.example file which outlines the variable names needed.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod
```
## Core dependencies used:
* typescript
* pg
* passport
* typeorm
* nodemailer
* graphql
* apollo-server-express
* bcrypt
* dotenv
* handlebars
* stripe
* class-validator
